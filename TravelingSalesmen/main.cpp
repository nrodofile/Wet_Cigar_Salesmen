 * File:  TSP.cpp
 *
 * Driver program for Travelling Salesman Problem.
 *
 * The Travelling Salesamen Problem works on graphs which adhere to the triangle inequality (the sum of the
 * lengths of any two sides must be greater than or equal to the length of the remaining side).  For this reason, this
 * program uses points on the Cartesian plane as the basis for its vertices and the Euclidean (straight line)
 * distance between them as the edge weight.
 *
 * This program can use as input:
 * 1.  Randomly generated points from the Cartesian plane
 * 2.  Points from the Cartesian plane read from a file (file name given as a command line argument)
 *
 * The points are only required to compute the edge weights between the vertices to satisfy the triangle inequality.
 *
 * 1.  Generate or read N points
 * 2.  Create an instance of a Graph.
 * 3.  Add a vertex for each point to the graph (store only the id).
 *      - the vertex will be added to an adjacency list for the graph
 *      - this adjacency list will store the edges in the Minimum Spanning Tree of the graph
 *      - each vertex will need to store the vertices it is adjacent to in the Minimum Spanning Tree for use in
 *        the Depth First Search which details the visit order of cities in the TSP tour.
 * 4.  Create an undirected edge from each point to every other point using the Euclidean distance between the two
 *     vertices as the edge weight.
 *      - This edge will be added to the adjacency matrix in the graph.
 *      - The edge weight from a vertex to itself will be 0.
 * 5.  Compute the distance of the optimal TSP tour.
 *      - This is only feasible using the Brute Force approach if NUM_CITIES < 11 +/- 1.
 *      - This is only feasible using the Dynamic Programming approach if NUM_CITIES < 21 +/- 2.
 *      - These upper bounds for NUM_CITIES depend on the memory and speed of the computer being used.
 * 6.  Compute the distance of the approximate TSP tour
 *      - Calculate the Minimum Spanning Tree for the input graph.
 *      - Store the edges in the graph's adjacency list.
 *      - Perform a Depth First Traversal of the sub-graph defined by the Minimum Spanning Tree
 *      - Calculate the distance of the tour given by the visit order of the Depth First Search.
 *      - Remember to include the distance from the final vertex back to the starting vertex in the tour.
 *
 *
 *  NOTES: The given code uses pointers to objects in most places.
 *         The Point class and Edge class defined in this solution use C++ Templates.
 *         *** Type parameters may be removed from this code without affecting the mark for the assignment. ***
